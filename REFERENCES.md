## AI Assistance Disclosure

AI assistance was used specifically for debugging and troubleshooting when the application crashed or encountered errors. Screenshots of console errors and terminal output were provided to ChatGPT to help identify and resolve issues.

**Note**: The original ChatGPT conversation cannot be shared publicly due to technical limitations:
- ChatGPT's shared links do not support conversations containing audio recordings from voice chats
- OpenAI's policies prevent sharing conversations with unsupported media types
- This limitation is due to privacy and data handling policies
